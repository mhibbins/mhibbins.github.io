### Detecting and characterizing introgression from genomic data

Genomic data has revealed that **introgression**, the hybridization and subsequent
back-crossing of closely related species or isolated lineages, is common
across the tree of life. I have been working on ways to take advantage of this
abundance of data to make more detailed and biologically informed inferences about 
the occurrence, direction, timing, and biological factors affecting introgression.

### Accounting for hemiplasy in comparative studies of trait evolution 
&nbsp;

Gene tree discordance is a widespread phenomenon where the topology of trees 
inferred at individual loci disagree both with each other and the species tree 
topology. Two major causes are incomplete lineage sorting and introgression.
**Hemiplasy** occurs when evolutionary change along a discordant branch results 
in trait patterns that look like convergent evolution, but actually result from a 
single origin. Classic phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for hemiplasy
when making inferences about trait evolution. I have been developing theory and software
with the goal of making more robust inferences in the presence of gene tree
discordance. 

### The evolution of gene regulation underlying complex traits

Transcriptomic datasets provide valuable insights into both functional aspects
of the biology of organisms and general patterns of quantitative trait evolution
among species. My research applies phylogenetic comparative methods to multispecies
transcriptomic datasets to answer questions at the intersection of these two 
approaches. In my postdoc I am using transcriptomic data to study the genus *Rumex*, 
which contains multiple independent origins of dioecy and X/Y sex determination from 
hermaphroditic ancestors. I am reconstructing the history of these traits over the 
*Rumex* phylogeny and investigating how they have affected the evolution of gene 
expression and recombination.
