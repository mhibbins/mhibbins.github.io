### Detecting and characterizing introgression from genomic data

Genomic data has revealed that **introgression**, the hybridization and subsequent
back-crossing of closely related species or isolated lineages, is common
across the tree of life. I have been working on ways to take advantage of this
abundance of data to make more detailed and biologically informed inferences about 
the occurrence, direction, timing, and biological factors affecting introgression.

### Accounting for hemiplasy in comparative studies of trait evolution 
&nbsp;

Gene tree discordance is a widespread phenomenon where the topology of trees 
inferred at individual loci disagree both with each other and the species tree 
topology. Two major causes are incomplete lineage sorting and introgression.
**Hemiplasy** occurs when evolutionary change along a discordant branch results 
in trait patterns that look like convergent evolution, but actually result from a 
single origin. Classic phylogenetic comparative methods do not account for hemiplasy
when making inferences about trait evolution. I have been approaching this problem
by writing software which uses coalescent simulation to estimate the probability of 
hemiplasy for binary traits. I have also been studying the contributions of incomplete 
lineage sorting and introgression to the evolution of gene expression using whole-transcriptome
data from wild tomatoes.
