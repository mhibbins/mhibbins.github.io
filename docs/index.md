Welcome to the Hibbins Lab in the Department of Biology at the University of Rochester! 
We study a variety of questions in phylogenomics, using primarily computational approaches 
that span theory, statistical methods development, and bioinformatic analysis of empirical datasets. 

The lab is looking for graduate students and postdocs.
Please get in touch if you're interested!
