### Welcome! My name's Mark Hibbins.

I'm a PhD candidate in Evolutionary Biology with a minor in Bioinformatics,
working in [Matthew Hahn's lab](https://hahnlab.sitehost.iu.edu/) at Indiana
University Bloomington. I'm broadly interested in molecular population genetics, phylogenetics,
and bioinformatics. 

This website is still under construction, so you may not be seeing complete
information at the moment. Please feel free to contact me by email at 
mhibbins at indiana.edu, or on social media.
