Welcome to the Hibbins Lab in the Department of Biology at the University of Rochester! 
We will be opening our doors in July of 2025. We study a variety of questions in 
phylogenomics, using primarily computational approaches that span theory, statistical
methods development, and bioinformatic analysis of empirical datasets. 

The lab is looking for graduate students and postdocs to join in Fall 2025 or later.
Please get in touch if you're interested!
